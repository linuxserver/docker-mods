# Auto-proxy - Docker mod for SWAG

This mod gives SWAG the ability to auto-detect running containers via labels and automatically enable reverse proxy for them.

## Requirements:
- This mod needs the [universal-docker mod](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/universal-docker) installed and set up with either mapping `docker.sock` or setting the environment variable `DOCKER_HOST=remoteaddress`.
- Other containers to be auto-detected and reverse proxied should be in the same [user defined bridge network](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag#docker-networking) as SWAG.
- Containers to be auto-detected and reverse proxied must have a label `swag=enable` at a minimum.
- To benefit from curated preset proxy confs we provide, the container name must match the container names that are suggested in our readme examples (ie. `radarr` and not `Radarr-4K`).

## Labels:
- `swag=enable` - required for auto-detection
- `swag_address=containername` - *optional* - overrides upstream app address. Can be set to an IP or a DNS hostname. Defaults to `container name`.
- `swag_port=80` - *optional* - overrides *internal* exposed port (if no preset conf and this label not set, auto-proxy will default to first detected exposed port)
- `swag_proto=http` - *optional* - overrides internal proto (defaults to http)
- `swag_url=containername.domain.com` - *optional* - overrides *server_name* (defaults to `containername.*`)
- `swag_auth=authelia` - *optional* - enables auth methods (options are `authelia`, `authentik`, `ldap` and `http` for basic http auth)
- `swag_auth_bypass=/api,/othersubfolder` - *optional* - bypasses auth for selected subfolders. Comma separated, no spaces.
- `swag_server_custom_directive=custom_directive;` - *optional* - injects the label value as is into the server block of the generated conf. Must be a valid nginx directive, ending with a semi colon.
- `swag_conf` - *optional* - Specify the name of a preset conf to use. Use this if your docker
  container name doesn't match what the preset conf expects. Useful for when you have multiple
  instances of the same image and they both can't have the same name. For example, if you had two
  Sonarr containers named `sonarr` and `sonarr_anime`, the second one would specify
  `swag_conf=sonarr`.


In SWAG docker arguments, set an environment variable `DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-docker|linuxserver/mods:swag-auto-proxy` and either add a volume mapping for `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`, or set an environment var `DOCKER_HOST=remoteaddress`.

## Security Consideration:
Mapping the `docker.sock`, especially in a publicly accessible container is a security liability. Since this mod only needs read-only access to the docker api, the recommended method is to proxy the `docker.sock` via a solution like [our docker socket proxy](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-socket-proxy), limit the access, and set `DOCKER_HOST=` to point to the proxy address.

Here's a sample compose yaml snippet for tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:
```yaml
  dockerproxy:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/socket-proxy:latest
    container_name: dockerproxy
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - CONTAINERS=1
      - POST=0
```
Then the env var in SWAG can be set as `DOCKER_HOST=dockerproxy`. This will allow docker cli in SWAG to be able to retrieve info on other containers, but it won't be allowed to spin up new containers.
